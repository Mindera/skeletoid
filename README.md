## Why should you use it?
Instead of copy pasting the same utils packages to each new project (and not having improvements propagated), just have this lib to help you! 
Also this provides out of the box a broad range of  utils.

This library is **divided into modules** to enable you to just use just those that you need (click on them to get more info on how to use them):


### [Base module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/base/)
- This provides vanilla utilities for Android (logging, analytics, threading..) without bringing any other big library attached to it

### [Kotlin extensions module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/kt-extensions/)
- This provides some useful Kotlin extensions that we have been using. It is a evergrowing module.

### [RxJava 2 module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/rxjava/)
- Do you use RxJava 2 & Kotlin? Well, this might be interesting for you! From operators to rx chain extensions we are adding it all here!

### [App Rating module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/apprating/)
- Do you want to ask you users to rate to your app? Here you go, quick and easy!

### [Barcode Scanner](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/barcodescanner/)
- Read all types of barcodes, even the weird and obscure ones with a few lines of code!

## Plugins for Base module

You are using [Base module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/base/) and want it to be plug and play:

### [Analytics - Module for Firebase](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/analytics-firebase/)
- With Firebase

### [Analytics - Module for Google Analytics](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/analytics-ga/)
- With Google Analytics

---

## Helpers for external libraries:

### [RxJava 2 - Performance Firebase](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/performance-firebase/)
- Some utils to help integrate RxJava 2 chain with Firebase performance tooling

---

## Wrappers for external libraries:

### [RxBindings module](https://github.com/Mindera/skeletoid/blob/master/rxbindings/)
- This is a simple wrapper around [RxBindings](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding) that aims to solve some specific issues

## Notes

- We are moving to a full Kotlin world, but you might still find some Java along the road.
- We move fast and we break things.. but we are friendly. Please drop us an issue/feature request and we will address it asap.
